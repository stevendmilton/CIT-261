    <h2>Object Definition</h2>
    <p>
      An object is a collection of related data and/or functionality which
      usually consist of several variables and functions which are called
      properties and methods when they are inside the object. Below is an example of a simple JavaScript object.
    </p>
    <p>
      const car = {}; This is all that is needed to create an object. This is an empty object so not much use. Let's make it more interesting.
    </p>
    <p>
      const car = {<br>
      make: 'Dodge',<br>
      model: 'Charger',<br>
      year: '2020',<br>
      options: ['4wd','spoiler','supercharger'],<br>
      desc: function() {<br>
      alert(this.year + ' ' + this.make + ' ' + this.model + ' with options ' + this.options[0] + ', ' + this.options[1] + ', and ' + this.options[2]); <br>
      }<br>
      }<br>
      Now this car has properties and a method to display the car. Next,
      we will create a constructor function that allows us to create many instances of an Car object.
    </p>
    <p>
      function Car(make, model,year) {
      this.make = make;
      this.model = model;
      this.year = year;
      this.displayType = function() {
      alert(this.year + " - " + this.make + " - " + this.model);
      };
      }
    </p>
    <p>
      To instantiate the object, use the following syntax:<br><br>
      var honda = new Car('Honda','Accord','2019');<br><br>
      You have two different methods of accessing the class properties. You can either use dot notation or you can use bracket notation.<br><br>
      Dot Notation: <br>
      alert(car.make); will return the make of the car<br><br>
      Bracket Notation: <br>
      alert(car["make"]); will also return the make of the car<br><br>
      To call the object function, use the following syntax: <br>
      car1.desc();<br>
      To call the displayType method, you will just use the object name with the dot and the method, like this:<br>
      <br>
      honda.displayType();
    </p>
    <p>
      By pressing the submit button below, we will create a Car function then instantiate three car models then update some properties in each
      car then display the new car information for each.
    </p>
    <button onclick="AddToTable()">Submit</button>
    <table id="carTable">
    </table>
